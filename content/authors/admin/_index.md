I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Michigan Traffic Lab](https://traffic.engin.umich.edu/) of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with [Prof. Henry X. Liu](https://traffic.engin.umich.edu/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html) in 2023, advised by [Prof. Keqiang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x58fnLQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and my Bachelor’s Degree in Automotive Engineering at Tsinghua University in 2018. During my PhD study, I was also advised by [Prof. Yang Zheng](https://zhengy09.github.io/) from University of California, San Diego. From Dec 2022 to Dec 2023, I was a visiting PhD student in the [Automatic Control Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/la/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), advised by [Prof. Colin Jones](https://people.epfl.ch/colin.jones).
